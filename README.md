# MarthaRaveCookies-Inventory-Manager
A customized inventory management platform that makes the business owner's job far easier

This project uses Google Scripts, Forms and Sheets to collect orders, process the orders and display them to the business owner.

There are many custom scripts that process the data as per the business owner's request.

Here are a few examples:

- Send automated emails to clients with exactly what they ordered and their order cost
- Save personal information of previous clients
- Sort orders into delivery dates
- Port order changes to all spreadsheets
